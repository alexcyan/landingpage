            <p id="statement">My name is Alex Yan and I am an aspiring graphic design student currently continuing my educational career at California State Eastbay. As a child I enjoyed the playful qualities of art and its simplicities such as: the feeling of unraveling a worn wax pencil, the swirl of elliptical patterns formed in a droplet of watercolors, or the extravagance of the many-uses of elmers glue. There was rarely a moment when I didn't feel that there was something amazing to be observed in the world and with that curiosity I gravitated to art. There were times when I endlessly felt that in order to progress I would have to take some time away from the craft and practice in something else, but the adventure of creating something free of intention was all too inviting. Somewhere in the stark expanse of a white canvas did I find that I knew very little about how art had changed my life and how I was more or less a product of a visually impacted environment. "I'm here in this moment, pressing on plastic that transforms my very thought into data while I stare into a single grouping of pixels that could captivate my mind for days on end. This is design right?"<br> <em>&mdash; alexcyan</em></p>
